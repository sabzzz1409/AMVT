CRUD Operations:

Create, Read, Update, Delete records in a database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL).
Authentication:

Session-based authentication (using cookies).
OAuth (e.g., Google, Facebook, GitHub login).
Two-factor authentication (2FA).
File Upload/Download:

Handle file uploads and downloads (e.g., using multer middleware).
WebSocket Communication:

Implement real-time communication using WebSockets (e.g., with socket.io).
Email/SMS Notification:

Send email notifications (e.g., with Nodemailer).
Send SMS messages using third-party services like Twilio.
API Integration:

Integrate external APIs (e.g., payment gateways like Stripe, Google Maps API).
Caching:

Implement caching (e.g., using Redis) to improve performance.
Data Validation:

Use validation libraries like Joi or express-validator to validate incoming data.
Rate Limiting:

Prevent abuse of APIs using rate limiting (e.g., with express-rate-limit).
Background Jobs/Queueing:

Handle long-running processes in the background (e.g., with Bull or Agenda).
Logging:
Implement logging systems (e.g., using Winston or Morgan) for monitoring and debugging.
Security:
Use security practices like helmet, CORS configurations, and input sanitization to protect against threats like XSS or SQL injection.
Web Scraping:
Scrape web data using libraries like Cheerio or Puppeteer.
Analytics/Tracking:
Collect user interaction data and analyze it using services like Google Analytics or custom tracking.
GraphQL:
Set up a GraphQL API (using libraries like Apollo Server) for more flexible queries.
Push Notifications:
Implement push notifications (e.g., with Push.js or Firebase Cloud Messaging).
Multilingual Support:
Support multiple languages in your app by integrating translation services (e.g., i18n).
Payment Processing:
Set up payment processing with platforms like Stripe, PayPal, etc.
These are just a few ideas; Node.js can handle a wide range of backend tasks depending on your project requirements.
